### 10. Missing Project Images Causing 404 and Runtime Errors (High)
**Type:** Bug  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Open  
**Location:** Image handling and database seeding

**Description:**
The database seed data references project images that don't exist in the filesystem, causing 404 errors when attempting to load them. This is also triggering malloc (memory) errors in Node.js, likely due to image optimization attempting to process non-existent files.

**Error Details:**

```
GET /projects/ecommerce-1.jpg 404 in 459ms (compile: 313ms, render: 145ms)
node(68435,0x172a9b000) malloc: *** error for object 0xca6dee020: pointer being freed was not allocated
node(68435,0x172a9b000) malloc: *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
```

**Affected Files:**
- `public/projects/` directory is empty but referenced images include:
  - `/projects/ecommerce-1.jpg`
  - `/projects/ecommerce-2.jpg`
  - `/projects/ecommerce-3.jpg`
  - `/projects/fitness-1.jpg`
  - `/projects/fitness-2.jpg`
  - `/projects/fitness-3.jpg`
  - `/projects/corporate-1.jpg`
  - `/projects/corporate-2.jpg`
  - And other project images referenced in database seed data

**Location in Code:**
- `prisma/seed.ts` - References these images in project data
- Components trying to load project images (portfolio pages, project cards, etc.)

**Expected Behavior:**
- Project images should exist in `public/projects/` directory
- Images should load without 404 errors
- Image optimization should work without malloc errors

**Actual Behavior:**
- 404 errors when trying to load project images
- Malloc errors suggesting memory issues in Node.js image processing
- Broken images across portfolio sections

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Start the development server
2. Navigate to any page showing project images
3. Observe 404 errors in console
4. See malloc errors in terminal

**Root Cause Analysis Needed:**
- Missing image files in `public/projects/` directory
- Image optimization (Sharp/Next.js Image) attempting to process non-existent files
- Database seed data referencing images that were never created
- Need to either: add actual image files, update seed data with correct paths, or implement placeholder images

**Suggested Fixes:**
1. Add actual project images to `public/projects/` directory
2. Update seed data to use placeholder images or external image URLs
3. Implement proper error handling for missing images in components
4. Consider using a placeholder service like Unsplash or Placeholder.com for seed data
