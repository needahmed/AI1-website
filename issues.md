## Open Issues Requiring More Details

**Note:** The issues listed below have been addressed. If any issues persist after restart, please provide specific details.

### ~~CSS/Layout Issues - RESOLVED ✅~~ (Updated: Oct 27, 2025 - Final Fix)
- ~~CSS styling issues causing vertical text display (each word on new line)~~ - **FULLY FIXED**
- ~~Container width constraints causing text wrapping issues~~ - **FIXED**
- ~~Layout and positioning CSS problems affecting sections~~ - **FIXED**
- ~~Container sizing and flexbox/grid issues~~ - **FIXED**

**Root Cause Identified:**
The vertical text issue was caused by:
1. Tailwind v4's `container` class not having proper width constraints
2. Missing `word-break` and `overflow-wrap` CSS properties
3. Paragraphs not having explicit width and display properties

**Complete Resolution (Oct 27, 2025 - Final Update):**
1. **Enhanced CSS Rules:**
   - Added `word-break: normal !important` and `overflow-wrap: normal !important`
   - Added explicit rules for paragraphs: `display: block !important`, `width: auto !important`
   - Fixed `.container` class with proper width constraints
   - Ensured `white-space: normal !important` on all text elements

2. **Component Fixes:**
   - Changed hero section container from `container` to `w-full max-w-7xl`
   - Added inline styles to subtitle paragraph with explicit width, display, and word-break properties
   - Ensured proper max-width (48rem) and centering with margins

3. **CSS Rules Applied:**
   - Applied `writing-mode: horizontal-tb !important` to all elements
   - Added `direction: ltr !important` for left-to-right text flow
   - Extended rules to cover all structural elements (div, section, article, etc.)

4. **Additional Fixes for Contact & Blog Pages:**
   - Fixed `SectionWrapper` component: replaced `container mx-auto max-w-7xl` with `w-full max-w-7xl mx-auto`
   - Fixed `Headline` component subtitle: added explicit width and word-break styles
   - Fixed `ContactHero` component: replaced `container` with `w-full max-w-7xl mx-auto`
   - Updated all layout components (header, footer, testimonials, services, tech-stack) to use explicit width classes
   - Applied consistent `w-full max-w-7xl mx-auto` pattern across all components

### 10. Missing Project Images Causing 404 and Runtime Errors (High)
**Type:** Bug  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Resolved ✅  
**Location:** Image handling and database seeding

**Description:**
The database seed data references project images that don't exist in the filesystem, causing 404 errors when attempting to load them. This is also triggering malloc (memory) errors in Node.js, likely due to image optimization attempting to process non-existent files.

**Error Details:**

```
GET /projects/ecommerce-1.jpg 404 in 459ms (compile: 313ms, render: 145ms)
node(68435,0x172a9b000) malloc: *** error for object 0xca6dee020: pointer being freed was not allocated
node(68435,0x172a9b000) malloc: *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
```

**Affected Files:**
- `public/projects/` directory is empty but referenced images include:
  - `/projects/ecommerce-1.jpg`
  - `/projects/ecommerce-2.jpg`
  - `/projects/ecommerce-3.jpg`
  - `/projects/fitness-1.jpg`
  - `/projects/fitness-2.jpg`
  - `/projects/fitness-3.jpg`
  - `/projects/corporate-1.jpg`
  - `/projects/corporate-2.jpg`
  - And other project images referenced in database seed data

**Location in Code:**
- `prisma/seed.ts` - References these images in project data
- Components trying to load project images (portfolio pages, project cards, etc.)

**Expected Behavior:**
- Project images should exist in `public/projects/` directory
- Images should load without 404 errors
- Image optimization should work without malloc errors

**Actual Behavior:**
- 404 errors when trying to load project images
- Malloc errors suggesting memory issues in Node.js image processing
- Broken images across portfolio sections

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Start the development server
2. Navigate to any page showing project images
3. Observe 404 errors in console
4. See malloc errors in terminal

**Root Cause Analysis Needed:**
- Missing image files in `public/projects/` directory
- Image optimization (Sharp/Next.js Image) attempting to process non-existent files
- Database seed data referencing images that were never created
- Need to either: add actual image files, update seed data with correct paths, or implement placeholder images

**Suggested Fixes:**
1. ~~Add actual project images to `public/projects/` directory~~
2. ~~Update seed data to use placeholder images or external image URLs~~ ✅
3. ~~Implement proper error handling for missing images in components~~ ✅
4. ~~Consider using a placeholder service like Unsplash or Placeholder.com for seed data~~ ✅

**Resolution (Completed on Oct 27, 2025):**
1. Updated `prisma/seed.ts` to use Unsplash placeholder images for all project images instead of local file references
2. Added proper error handling to Image components (`project-card.tsx`, `project-gallery.tsx`) with:
   - `onError` handlers that set error state
   - Fallback UI with icon when images fail to load
   - Graceful degradation for missing or broken images
3. All project images now load from Unsplash API with appropriate dimensions
4. No more 404 errors or malloc errors related to missing images
5. Components handle image loading failures gracefully with proper fallback UI

**Files Modified:**
- `prisma/seed.ts` - Updated all project image paths to use Unsplash URLs
- `components/portfolio/project-card.tsx` - Added error handling and fallback UI
- `components/portfolio/project-gallery.tsx` - Added error handling and fallback UI
- `components/home/portfolio-section.tsx` - Added error state tracking and fallback UI
- `next.config.ts` - Enhanced with better image optimization settings and error handling
- `app/globals.css` - Comprehensive horizontal text orientation rules with !important flags

**Database Status:**
- ✅ Database successfully reseeded with Unsplash image URLs
- ✅ Prisma client regenerated and synced with schema
- ✅ All 5 projects updated with working image URLs
- ✅ All 6 blog posts successfully seeded

**Error Handling Improvements:**
- ✅ Added `onError` handlers to all Image components
- ✅ Implemented fallback UI with ImageIcon for failed images
- ✅ Enhanced Next.js config with better image optimization settings
- ✅ Added error state tracking in portfolio components
